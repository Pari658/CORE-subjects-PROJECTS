C++ PROJECT: IP ADDRESS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
========================================

📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW
-------------------
This project simulates an IP Address Management System used by a network administrator
to assign, validate, and manage IP addresses for multiple devices.

The system demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as
Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Static members, Friend classes, and
Exception & File Handling.

---

💡 MAIN FEATURES
----------------
1. Add new devices with name and MAC address.
2. Assign either Static or Dynamic IPv4 addresses.
3. Validate IP address format.
4. Detect duplicate IP addresses.
5. Handle invalid and duplicate IPs using exceptions.
6. Log all assigned IPs into a file (logs/assigned_ips.txt).
7. Admin panel (friend class) to view all devices and total IPs assigned.

---

🧩 OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN
-------------------------
Classes used:
- **IPAddress** → Base abstract class for IP operations.
- **IPv4** → Derived class for IPv4 validation (polymorphism).
- **Device** → Stores device details (name, MAC, assigned IP).
- **NetworkManager** → Manages devices, assigns IPs, and handles file logging.
- **Admin** → Friend class with full access to device list and statistics.

OOP Concepts:
- Encapsulation → Private data in Device and NetworkManager.
- Inheritance → IPv4 inherits from IPAddress.
- Polymorphism → validateIP() function overridden.
- Static Member → Tracks total number of assigned IPs.
- Friend Class → Admin accesses NetworkManager's private members.
- Exception Handling → Invalid and duplicate IPs.
- File Handling → Saves device info to logs/assigned_ips.txt.

⚙️ REQUIREMENTS
---------------
- C++ Compiler (GCC 6.3.0 or higher)
- Supports C++14 or above
- No external libraries required

🛠️ HOW TO COMPILE
------------------
g++ -std=c++14 main.cpp src/*.cpp -I include -o ip_manager

Run:
./ip_manager      (Linux/Mac)
ip_manager.exe    (Windows)

📘 SAMPLE OUTPUT
----------------
Enter device name: Laptop
Enter MAC address: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
Static or Dynamic IP? (s/d): s
Enter IPv4 address: 192.168.0.10
✅ Device added successfully.

Do you want Admin View? (y/n): y

===== ADMIN VIEW =====
Device: Laptop | MAC: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E | IP: 192.168.0.10
------------------------
Total IPs Assigned: 1
