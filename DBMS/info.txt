Project Title: Space Station Resource Monitoring System
--------------------------------------------------------

Description:
-------------
This project is a MySQL-based database management system designed to efficiently monitor and manage 
the essential resources, supplies, crew activities, and system operations of a space station. 
It ensures automated updates, safety alerts, and accurate tracking of all critical operations.

Main Features:
---------------
1. Tracks available resources like Water, Oxygen, Fuel, and Food in different storage units.
2. Monitors resource consumption by crew members.
3. Maintains medical supply stock and expiry details.
4. Logs maintenance tasks assigned to crew members.
5. Tracks upcoming resupply deliveries for resources.
6. Records important system logs such as Life Support, Power, and Communication statuses.
7. Implements automation using SQL Triggers, Functions, and Cursors.

Database Objects Used:
-----------------------
- Tables:
  StorageUnit, Resource, ResourceLevel, CrewMember, RoleInfo, 
  ConsumptionLog, ResupplySchedule, MaintenanceTask, 
  MedicalSupply, MedicalLog, SystemLog

- Triggers:
  1. trg_after_consumption → Reduces resource level after consumption.
  2. trg_after_resupply_delivery → Increases resource level when resupply is delivered.

- Cursors:
  1. Check_Resource_Levels() → Logs alerts for resources below minimum threshold.
  2. Check_Expired_Medical_Supplies() → Logs alerts for expired medical items.

- Functions:
  1. GetResourceStatus(resID) → Returns LOW / NORMAL / FULL based on thresholds.
  2. CheckMedicalExpiry(medID) → Returns 'Expired' or 'Valid' based on expiry date.

SQL Concepts Covered:
----------------------
- DDL: CREATE, ALTER, DROP
- DML: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- DQL: SELECT with JOINs, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
- Constraints: PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, ON DELETE/UPDATE actions
- Views, Functions, Triggers, Procedures, Cursors
- Automation and Integrity Enforcement

Sample Queries:
----------------
1. List all active crew members with their assigned modules.
2. Find resources below their minimum threshold.
3. Show total resource consumption by each crew member.
4. List all pending maintenance tasks.
5. Display expired medical supplies.

Usage:
-------
Run the SQL file in MySQL Workbench or any compatible database tool.
Make sure to enable event_scheduler for automated tasks if required.
